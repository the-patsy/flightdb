# flightdb

My experiment getting familiar with python/SQL coding.

bash steup.py on Debian-based system to get started. Other systems not yet supported.

## TODO

- Use API to pull data from opensky
- Put API data into postgres friendly format
- Add postgres entry once converted
- See if it's possible to check for date esisting in DB already before adding data to avoid duplicate entries.
- QoL for setup.sh including getting the intial DB created.
- Remove hard coded creds for script, force ask or as flags
